The term "melting pot" was coined to describe New York's densely populated immigrant neighborhoods. 
The diversity of culture and food products is great. There are many restaurants in New York City, each belonging to a different category such as Chinese, Indian, French, etc.
Therefore, in this project, we will make a list of the main areas of New York City where there are good French restaurants and visualize them.
Data

For this project, we need the following data:
- New York City data that lists boroughs, neighborhoods, and their latitude and longitude.
        Data source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset

- French restaurants in every neighborhood in New York City.
        Data source : API Fousquare with the French restaurant filter 

Approach:
- Describe the dataset on newyork.
- Filter all places that are French restaurants .

- Using the info for each restaurant, we will sort this data.
- Then we will view the ranking
